For my CPA02, the webapp I created is called The Book Logger. You can use it to keep track of each book you read, including its title, author, genre, a short description, and the rating you would give it. You can also look through other users' book logs, with options to search by title, author, genre, and rating.  
# Running the app  
You can use the app online at its heroku site, or download the source code from github and execute ".\startup.ps1" in your terminal to run the app locally.  
  
# Using the app  
When you start the app, you'll be directed to the homepage.
