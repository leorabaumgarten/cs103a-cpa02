For my CPA02, the webapp I created is called The Book Logger. You can use it to keep track of each book you read, including its title, author, genre, a short description, and the rating you would give it. You can also look through other users' book logs, with options to search by title, author, genre, and rating.  
# Running the app  
You can use the app online at its heroku site, or download the source code from github and execute ".\startup.ps1" in your terminal to run the app locally.  
  
# Using the app  
When you start the app, you'll be directed to the homepage.

From this page, you can use any of the search forms to view book logs. For example, selecting "Fantasy" in the search by genre form brings you to the following page:

As users continue to log, the searches will show more and more books.  
In the navigation bar, you can select "My Books." If you haven't logged in yet, it will redirect you to the following signin page:

Selecting "Signin/Signup" will also bring you to that page.  
After signing in or signing up, you can access the "My Books" page:

It will show you a complete list of all the books that you've logged personally. Also, as you can see, logging in changes the navigation bar option to allow you to log out. If you scroll down further, you'll see that the "My Books" page also allows you to add more books:

And that's The Book Logger! Enjoy!
