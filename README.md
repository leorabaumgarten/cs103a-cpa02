For my CPA02, the webapp I create is called The Book Logger. You can use it to keep track of each book you read, including its title, author, genre, a short description, and the rating you would give it. You can also look through other users' book logs, with options to search by title, author, genre, and rating.
You can use the app online at its heroku site, or download the source code from github and run .\startup.ps1 in your terminal.
